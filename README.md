# Overview
This repository contains the code for parsing the raw measurement data
from [our ISP measurement campaign](link-to-Zenodo) and recreating the
plots in the paper "Measuring Network Latency from a Wireless ISP:
Variations Within and Across Subnets", accepted for IMC '24.

Most of the code is contained within Jupyter notebooks. To actually
run these notebooks, you will need to download the data files from
[Zenodo](link-to-Zenodo) and place them in the data folder.
